    "While I was training for my half marathon, I remember using Chat GPT-4 to create a mock training plan schedule for me, but I didn't realize that this wasn't the only thing I should be worried about. I didn't know that shoes, as well as running accessories, would be an important factor. So, in order to prepare for the prompting and creation of my model, I thought it was really important to text existing LLMs in order to see how I can make my model even better for beginners who know nothing about running. Here are several examples of what existing LLMs suggest. I will be using the same prompting to make it controlled and see how they differ in responses. "
