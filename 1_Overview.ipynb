    "Given that there are runners of all age groups, all experience levels, with varying body types, I wanted to create a few sample cases that we could use to test the **Motiva** model. :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A person with their Strava data**. Just wants to see if they're able to **run at a 6:00 pace in two months**.\n",
    "2. A **complete beginner** who doesn’t know where to start and **doesn't have strava**. She signed up for the **half marathon** for March 30th and it’s currently December 14th. She has really old shoes (500+ mi), she gets **really bad shin splints**, and runs an 11:00 pace. She can’t even run two miles straight.\n",
    "3. Someone who is trying to **PR a 5k**. He **has some strava data**. He currently just bought new shoes, runs at a 9:30 pace, and is a casual runner who runs 5 times a week. He doesn’t have any injuries.\n",
    "4. A person who runs a lot and has ran various half marathons, but is **trying to shoot for running an ultra marathon**. They have a lot of **knee and shin problems**. Their shoes are also getting really bad. She only has 4 months to train, even though ultramarathons usually take half a year to a full year to train for. She still wants to try it out. Doesn't have strava data only uses her Nike Run app.\n",
    "5. He is currently **60 years old**, and wants to start running soon. **Doesn't have a strava.** He hasn’t ran in a very long time, but wants to get started because of his daughter. He has a lot of different physical issues; his disc is really bad, he’s been smoking since he was 14, and often has body aches. How can he run 5 miles straight by the end of the month?\n"
