    "### He is currently 60 years old, and wants to start running soon. He hasn't ran in a very long time, but wants to get started because of his daughter. He has a lot of different physical issues; his disc is really bad, he's been smoking since he was 14, and often has body aches. How can he run 5 miles straight by the end of the month?"
